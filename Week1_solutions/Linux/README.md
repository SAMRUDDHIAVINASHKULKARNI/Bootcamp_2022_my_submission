# Getting Familiar With Linux

## Question 1

* The variant of <code>ls</code> command: ls -a.
* The variant of <code>cp</code> to copy folder: 
    * <code>cp -a</code> : archive files
    * <code>cp -f</code> : force copy by removing the designation file if needed
    * <code>cp -i</code> : iteractive - ask before overrite
    * <code>cp -l</code> : link file instead of copying
    * <code>cp -L</code> : follow symbolic link
    * <code>cp -n</code> : no file overite
    * <code>cp -R</code> : recursive copy
    * <code>cp -u</code> : update
    * <code>cp -v</code> : print information message
* The command to rename a file: sudo apt-get install rename


## Question 2
* How many CPU sockets, cores, and processors does your machine have?
    * Sockets : 1
    * Cores: 6
    * Processors: 12
* What is the frequency of each processor?
    * 3.00 GHz
* How much memory does your machine have?
    * 8.00 GB
* How much of it is free and available? What is the difference between them?
    * Free: 3 GB, Available: 6 GB
    * The difference between free memory vs. available memory in Linux is, free memory is not in use and sits there doing nothing. While available memory is used memory that includes but is not limited to caches and buffers, that can be freed without the performance penalty of using swap space.
* What is the total number of user-level processes in the system?
    * 8
* What is the total number of forks since the boot in the system?
    * 345
* How many context switches has the system performed since bootup?
    * 2

## Question 3
* What is the PID of the process running the cpu command?
    * 7261
* How much CPU and memory does this process consume?
    * 100% and 0%
* What is the current state of the process? For example, is it running or in a blocked state or a zombie state?
    * Running
